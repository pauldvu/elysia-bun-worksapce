# Elysia Bun Workspace Mono-Repo

- Importing and exporting multiple type defiitions from different apps in a service industry.
- Showing an app consuming type information from a sister service.
- Shows an example of a elysia plugin being imported from an internal package and then being consumed.
- Demonstrating how to use `edenTreaty` on the server to call sister services.
  - *This is assuming each service is on a different deployment. 


1. run each server in a new terminal instance
2. visit http://localhost:3000
3. Inspect the logs to se where each service was called from

Disclaimer: Typically each service would be on it's own deployment, make sure proper security and best practices are in place. This is just a demo for discord.
